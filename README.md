# Welcome to the Github of the Cycle-Analyst!

You can find the deployed app [here](cycle-analyst.herokuapp.com)

Cycle-Analyst uses [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org), [DVRPC Bicycle Traffic Data](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/pedbikecounts/), and [PennDot Crash Data](https://crashinfo.penndot.gov/PCIT/welcome.html) to route cyclists in Downtown Philadelphia away from dangerous intersections.

Acknowledgements: Thank you to [Dave Monteiro's DogGo Repo](https://github.com/davemonteiro/DogGo) which served as a building block for the frontend part of the app.py file.
